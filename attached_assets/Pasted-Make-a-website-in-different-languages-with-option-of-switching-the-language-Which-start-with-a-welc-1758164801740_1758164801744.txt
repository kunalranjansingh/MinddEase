Which start with a welcome page with greetings like good morning with some emojis having soft animated color and having daymode nightmode and a language navbar jst bottom to the day night mode where it haves options to change the languages,  after clicking on welcome, in next page I want 3 section in the bottom with navbars in middle the home and in the right I want profile and in left I want dashboard.  And after clicking on the previous welcome bar the next page opens in automatically the home page and the user can switch with the bars in the bottom.
** I want a sos  option in circular form in each and every pages at the same position in rightmost down side in medium size.
